    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and structure complex software systems by modeling them as a collection of objects that interact with each other. OOP aims to provide a clear and modular approach to software development, making it easier to design, implement, maintain, and understand code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Breaking down a complex system into smaller, self-contained objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This allows for better code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstracting away unnecessary details and focusing on essential features and behaviors. By creating abstract classes and interfaces, OOP enables the development of reusable and extensible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulating data and methods within objects, hiding the internal implementation details and providing a well-defined interface for interacting with the object. Encapsulation promotes data integrity, code reusability, and reduces code dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Allowing objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects, creating a hierarchy of classes. Inheritance promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the ability to model real-world relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on different forms and respond differently based on their context. Polymorphism allows for code flexibility, abstraction, and the ability to write more generic code that can handle different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP promotes the development of robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.\n",

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "In Python, an object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is a specific instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python encapsulate data (attributes) and functionality (methods) into a single entity. Each object has a unique identity, state, and behavior. The identity of an object is unique and can be obtained using the id() function. The state of an object refers to the values of its attributes, which can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.attribute). The behavior of an object is defined by the methods associated with its class, and it determines how the object can be interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object in Python, you need to instantiate a class by calling its constructor method. The constructor method is usually named __init__() and is responsible for initializing the object's attributes."

    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure, behavior, and attributes of objects. It serves as a template for creating multiple objects of the same type. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and functionality (methods) into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class acts as a user-defined data type, allowing you to create objects with specific attributes and behaviors. The attributes of a class are represented by variables called instance variables, and the behaviors are defined by methods, which are functions associated with the class."

    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, attributes and methods are the two fundamental components of a class that define the behavior and characteristics of objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes, also known as instance variables or properties, are variables that store data specific to each object created from the class. They represent the state or characteristics of an object. Attributes define the data associated with an object and can be of different data types such as integers, strings, lists, or even other objects. Each object can have its own unique values for these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that objects created from the class can perform. Methods operate on the data stored in the attributes of an object or manipulate the object's state. They encapsulate functionality related to the class and allow objects to interact with and modify their own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can perform various operations, such as retrieving or modifying attribute values, performing calculations, interacting with other objects, and providing specific functionalities. Methods can also take parameters to accept external data for processing or return values as results."

    "\n",
    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used within a class, but they differ in their scope and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within the class but outside any methods.\n",
    "Class variables have the same value for all objects of the class.\n",
    "They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "Class variables can be accessed using the class name or any object of the class.\n",
    "If a class variable is modified, the change is reflected in all instances of the class.\n",
    "Instance Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are unique to each instance (object) of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within the methods of the class or within the constructor method (__init__()).\n",
    "Instance variables have different values for each object of the class.\n",
    "They are used to store data that varies between instances of the class.\n",
    "Instance variables are accessed and modified through the individual objects (instances) of the class.\n",

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods represents the instance (object) on which the method is called. It is a convention to name this parameter as self, although any valid variable name can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter allows methods to access and manipulate the attributes and other methods of the object. It acts as a reference to the instance itself, providing a way for methods to interact with the specific instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method and assigns it to the self parameter. This allows the method to access the object's attributes and call other methods associated with the object."
